## :zap: Usage

### :abc: Pre-requisites
Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): Ensure Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the provided links.

These prerequisites are necessary for running and building the project. Make sure to have them installed before proceeding.


###  :electric_plug: Installation
1. Clone the repository: 

```jsx
$ git clone https://github.com/migalabs/eth-seer.git
```

Or if you have SSH key:

```jsx
$ git clone git@github.com:migalabs/eth-seer.git
```

2. Create .env file within the `packages/client` and `packages/server` directories. There are examples in both directories of these files. (`packages/client/.env.example` and `packages/server/.env.example`).

### :package: Commands
- To install dependencies:

```jsx
$ npm run ci
```

- To run the client:

```jsx
$ npm run app
```

- To run the server:

```jsx
$ cd packages/server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

- Connect to database
An example database connection is:
```
NETWORKS='[
        { "network": "mainnet", "user": "ethseer-reader", "host": <ip>, "name": "ethseer-mainnet", "port": 5432, "password": "pass" },
        { "network": "goerli", "user": "ethseer-reader", "host": <ip>, "name": "ethseer-goerli", "port": 5432, "password": "pass" },
        ]'
```

### :pencil: Execution

`docker-compose up -d`

All systems should boot and start working as normal.



### :package: Bundle Setup
Ethseer's data is powered by [GotEth](https://github.com/migalabs/goteth). Thus, please refer [to this repository](https://github.com/migalabs/eth-coffee), which contains all the needed configurations to easily run GotEth with Ethseer.

### :cactus: Branches
1. **`dev`** is the development branch.

2. **`main`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.
   
**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `dev` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.

## :spider_web: Supported Networks
Ethseer is compatible with the following Blockchain networks:

- **Mainnet:** The primary Ethereum network used for transactions and contracts in the production environment.
- **Goerli:** A test network for Ethereum, used for development and testing. Goerli will be deprecated soon.
- **Sepolia:** A test network for Ethereum designed specifically for developers to test and experiment with their smart contracts and DApps before deploying them on the mainnet.
- **Holesky:** A test network for Ethereum, the purpose is to closely replicate real conditions on the Ethereum network.
- **Devnet9:** A devnet network for Ethereum Devnet-cancun ([EIP4844](https://www.eip4844.com/)) upgrade.

When using Ethseer, make sure to configure the appropriate network based on your needs, whether it's for operations on the main network (Mainnet) or for testing in a development environment.
